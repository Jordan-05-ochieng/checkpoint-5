The design of this landing page is built on a modern, clean, and responsive foundation using Bootstrap 5. The goal was to create a professional-looking e-commerce page that is both visually appealing and highly functional.

1. Framework & Responsiveness
Bootstrap 5: This framework was chosen to provide a robust and consistent layout system. Using its grid system (.row, .col-md, .col-lg) ensures the page is responsive out of the box, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Key Bootstrap classes like shadow-sm, rounded-pill, and text-center were used for quick styling.

Mobile-First Design: The page's structure and styling prioritize smaller screens, with the layout expanding for larger displays. This is evident in the product grid, where items stack vertically on mobile and rearrange into a three-column layout on larger devices.

2. Color Palette & Typography
Color Palette: A professional and clean color scheme was selected. Dark gray (#212529) is used for the navbar and footer to create a strong, stable brand presence. A bright blue (#0d6efd) serves as the primary action color for buttons and active links, providing a clear visual cue for user interaction. Lighter grays (#f8f9fa and #fff) are used for backgrounds to make the content pop and prevent eye strain.

Typography: The Inter font was chosen for its clean, modern, and highly readable design. Different font weights (300 to 700) are used to create a clear typographical hierarchy, with bolder weights for headings and a lighter weight for body text to improve scannability.

3. Layout & User Experience (UX)
Hero Section: The hero section uses a captivating background image with a dark overlay to make the white text and CTA button stand out. The min-height: 80vh ensures the hero section fills a large part of the screen, creating a strong first impression.

Product Grid: The 9-item product grid is a classic e-commerce layout. Using Bootstrap's card component (.card) ensures each product is presented cleanly with a title, description, and call-to-action. The hover effect (transform: translateY(-5px)) adds a subtle, interactive element that enhances the user experience.

Carousel: A carousel is included to showcase featured products or promotions, providing an engaging way to highlight key items without taking up too much vertical space.

Contact Form: A simple, clean contact form is provided at the bottom to encourage user engagement. It is contained within a card with a light shadow, making it feel distinct and professional.

Sticky Navbar: The sticky-top class on the navbar keeps the navigation menu visible as the user scrolls, making it easy to jump between sections of the page at any time.
